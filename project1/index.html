Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he played a pivotal role in Indiaâ€™s space and missile development programs, contributing significantly to the success of ISRO and DRDO. His leadership in the development of the Agni and Prithvi missiles made India a formidable player in defense technology. A recipient of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, Dr. Kalam was also a passionate advocate for education, youth empowerment, and innovation. He authored several inspirational books, including Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds, and remained a beloved figure for his humility, vision for a developed India, and tireless dedication to the nation.
